            <h1>09.03.2023</h1>
            <p>On September 3rd, Bambi was picked up from IKEA! My first plant adoption while living here in New York. </p>
            <br>
            <p>It was love at first sight… After seeing her lovely fluid roots I knew I had to adopt her and bring her home. The name Bambi came almost immediately, the way her roots raise her slightly above the ground makes her look like a deer creature with her leaves as her antlers. The space below her creates this hidden nook underneath, perfect for a little creature to rest in.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Bambi’s species, the Ginseng Ficus, is native to Southeast Asia just like me! She thrives in sunlight and fortunately is very easy for a newbie plant owner to take care of. She also loves to stay moist and doesn’t like to be under-watered.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Adopting Bambi is a symbolic start of my new era here in New York City, we are both in it for the long ride and to adjust to this new yet exciting environment together!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately she has been losing quite a few leaves now and then ;-; Maybe it’s the new environment? I’ll need to keep an eye out for that.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I think something I definitely need to do next is to repot Bambi, this pot is too small for her roots to grow further.</p>
